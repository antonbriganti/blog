# Mentoring Tips And Tricks I’ve Gone and Learned 

My LinkedIn profile headline says that I’m passionate about mentoring, and while I did add that to make me look good to recruiters, it’s actually true. I’ve been lucky enough to have had a lot of good mentors, and I’ve also been lucky enough to be a mentor myself. Throughout all these experiences, I’ve come to have a great appreciation for the “craft” of mentorship.

It’s been a fun learning journey as I’ve tried to figure out what mentoring techniques and philosophies work for me and why they works. Now while I could have probably read some books and learned the theory behind it all, I instead tried a lot of things and saw what worked and what didn’t work. I thought it’d be good to share what has been working for me, so hopefully someone starting their own mentoring journey can learn something that’s helpful for them.

Before we go any further, it’d be good to note that this post is written from the perspective of software engineering mentorship. I’m sure some of the things I say can be applicable in a general sense, but that’s the context we’re working with. My mentoring experience is also focused on graduates, so that also influences my views and approaches. 

## So, what is mentoring?
I think it’s important to set the scene with what I think mentoring is. Mentoring is something that goes beyond the scope of just teaching someone a concept or skill. It’s more of a complete partnership, where a mentor and mentee work together to not only build up the mentee’s skillset, but also help develop each other. It’s a symbiotic relationship, where both sides are getting to learn and grow alongside each other. Even if a mentor is more senior/more experienced than their mentee, I personally find it hard to believe that a mentor will never learn anything while mentoring. I’d go so far as to say that it’s probably a sign of a bad mentoring relationship if they don’t. 

It’s a pretty cheesy analogy, but if it’s a “learning journey”, a mentor helps set the destination and the route taken to get there, but the journey is something undertaken by both of them. 
 

## ✨  Here are some things I’ve done that have helped ✨ 

### Figure out what work schedule and style works for everyone
I’ve put this first because I think it’s something that everyone should do first. Everyone has times that they feel more productive, and their own preferred way of learning. A good way to start any mentoring relationship is figuring that all out up front, so that a comfortable work schedule and pace is established quick. 

Something important to note about this is that these preferences can and will change, and that’s a-okay. Keeping that in mind, it’s important to check in (not just with the mentee but also the mentor/mentors!) once in a while and see if the current way of working is still working for everyone. 

### “Explain it to me away from code”
This is a technique I use when someone is trying to implement something in code but having a hard time putting it all together. It’s as straightforward as the title, I ask them to explain what they’re trying to do as if they’re trying to do it “in real life”. 

Thinking in a code first way can be really hard, especially when we’re first learning how to code. It’s like when you’re learning a new language, you can’t just think in that language and if you do, you end up becoming a lot more confused. It’s easier to instead try and translate it from your native language to the new language.I find helping them take a step back and recentering the situation as  “what are the steps we need to take to solve this” as opposed to “what is the code we need to write to solve this” helps get them into a better frame of mind about the actual problem, and then we use real world flow of events as a jumping off point for the code we’re trying to write. It’s also a good way to help reinforce the fact that we don’t (usually) write code about abstract concepts, it’s a tool we use to help solve a problem. 

### Use Objective Metrics For Measuring Growth
That title sounds so corporate but I couldn’t find a better way to succinctly describe the idea. It can be hard to feel like progress is being made, and while a mentor can positively reinforce their mentee, they might feel like the mentor is just saying that to be polite. Imposter syndrome is a real big mental block for everyone, but I know in at least my own experiences, it hits a lot harder when you’re newer to a role.

So to fix that problem, it’s good to have some kind measuring stick that everyone agrees on as being a measure of progress. For best effect, it needs to be something solid and with clear outcomes. It can be something like a set of goals with well defined acceptance criteria, or it could even be as rigid as a skillset rubric.

Whatever is used, both the mentor and mentee should refer back to it as tasks are completed, and have a conversation about how they’re going compared to metrics. The goal is to have an open, safe discussion, where if there’s no progression that’s not inherently a bad thing. It happens, and it’s okay to sometimes only take a side step rather than forwards step. By the end of the metric check in, it’s clear how far the mentee has come and it doesn’t seem like the mentor is just trying to emptily encourage them with no proof. 

### We’re all in this together… 
Mentoring doesn’t have to happen without support, in isolation from the rest of the world. When we work, even if we’re working on something by ourselves, we work in teams and we work alongside other teams.  So why don’t we do that all the time when it comes to mentoring? I’ve found it to be a really good experience to reach out to other people and get them to sit in on a mentoring session or two. 

The reason behind this can vary, sometimes it’s because I might have a blank spot in my knowledge and want to bring in someone who knows better than I do, other times it’s just to mix things up a bit and get in a new voice and point of view. It can also help make a mentee feel more comfortable talking about their work or showing off their code, especially if they’re not used to the experience. In my experiences, it helps create a bit more of a comfortable space if there’s more familiar faces than unfamiliar ones. 

### Mentors need to work too
It’s a small note compared to the rest of these but it’s really important that mentors don’t just wax poetic and talk about concepts and practices. Mentors need to be hands on, writing code alongside their mentee in real pairing sessions. When you’re the one who’s always coding, it can be a very exhausting experience, especially if you’re learning a lot of new things at once. It’s good to let them take a break!

It also helps show that mentors are not big geniuses who know everything and write amazing code in one try, since it’s absolutely inevitable that you’re going to get something wrong. It helps normalise difficulty and failure, so hopefully they don’t think “I can’t do this because I’m bad” and instead think “this happens to everyone, just gotta keep at it”.

### It’s not just code
Last but certainly not least, a mentoring relationship is not just about building up the mentee’s ability to code or general developer skillset. As a mentor, you’re a key point of support for your mentee. It’s important to build up a general rapport and not make everything just about dev. To be honest, when things are kept to just strictly business for a long time, it can feel almost transactional in nature, like a mentor is only there to say they mentored on a resume. Personally, it also feels antithetical to what I view as the core of the mentoring experience, the concept of sharing that journey together. 

Now, it’s easy for me as someone who’s more on the extrovert side of the spectrum to say “Yeah just make friends with people LOL”. But you’re not always going to have mentees who are extroverted, and you might not even be someone who’s extroverted yourself. The best advice I can give is that you don’t have to force a relationship by constantly trying to talk about things that aren’t code related or anything. Just communicate genuinely, and it’ll happen naturally. 

## And that’s it!
I’m sure as I continue to mentor at different levels and in different contexts, these techniques and thoughts will change and I’ll probably develop some new ones too.

Mentoring is genuinely one of the most I rewarding things I’ve done in my relatively short career.  I’d encourage anyone who’s interested in trying to seize the opportunity. And if you do, I hope that at least one of these tips and/or tricks help out with your mentoring journey.
